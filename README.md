I can't believe I had to create a whole project to describe this gift idea *sigh*

I really want a leather ringed binder. Something like [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/792240786/3-ring-binder-portfolioleather-binder?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=a4+leather+binder&ref=sc_gallery-1-1&plkey=cbef9f9af67d23734d3d8de36a8d554a4b553a69%3A792240786&pro=1&frs=1&col=1).

However, it doesn't have to be this exact one! There are lots of good option to be found [here](https://www.etsy.com/market/a4_leather_binder?min=0&max=50).

I didn't find any good options on Amazon. What I am looking for is:

- Something leather, or faux leather, or a nice fabric would be fine. Something that looks and feels nice and will hold up. 
- Something low-profile. I would really prefer no zippers (makes the writing experience terrible!), not too many pockets or folders. This is for holding paper and writing in (I saw one with a calculator built in which is ridiculous for several reasons)
- Someting bigish A5 or A4 should do the trick

Ring number shouldn't matter, I think three or six are both fine. 

Many of these binders come with the option to customize them. I think customization is a cool option, but totally not mandatory!
That being said, if you do get one that can be customized any combination of:
- Paul Storm
- Paul WW Storm
- 沐子风
- My [signature](https://github.com/paulwstorm/uploads/blob/main/Signature%20(transparent%20background).png)

I talked to the guy who runs the shop for the binder I linked and even those it says "only text" he said it was fine to send over a logo, so I think that .png should work.

Anyway, I am sorry for being sooooo prescriptive. I just really like these notebooks and have a lot of thoughts. I don't care too much about the color, there are lots of different designs, whether you get it customized or not, what size you choose, these are all things which don't matter too much to me.
And if you want to get some paper to fill any type of graph paper to match the size and ring number of the binder would be fine. You could also get some dividers to go with it, or find some fancy paper. IDK.
